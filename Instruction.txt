## Need to define the flow and reactions
### Refactor Upload -- Start
### Client -- ready signal
### Refactor Display
### Client -- receive, signal next
### Refactor next
### Client -- not good, signal pause
### ..... repeat
### Refactor nothing left --- End ----
## PARALLEL --- Both need to be ready
### Client --- saving all stuff, ready signal
### Refactor Ready, since might need to upload
### Refactor --- dispaly next
##......
#### Better keep upload as a seperate thread, not in the reaction chain
### meanwhile, need to keep the process alive,,, keys as well as mouse actions
